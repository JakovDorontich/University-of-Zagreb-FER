# Help for the second assignment

If you need some help with the first part of the assignment, here it is.

Cron is a daemon that is used to execute scheduled events at a certain point in
time. In the example the script `/usr/local/bin/backup` which is executed every
fifth minute in an hour (0,5,10,...).
Look into the script:
```
    $ cat /usr/local/bin/backup
```

This is a bash script. At the beginning of the script a file is defined, that is
later forwarded to the `source` command. If such a file exists (`if [ -f $script ];
then`) then all regular commands specified in the script are executed. You need
to create the file `/tmp/smth` with the command that will add the user `sui` to the
group `sudo`. That is done with the `usermod` command.

You need to specify the whole path to the command `usermod` for it to execute
properly. Wait for the script to execute. Logout and login so that the group
membership is applied.
With the command:
```
    $ sudo su
    [sudo] password for sui: (Password for user sui: Internet1)
```
You should come to this:
```
    root@sui:/home/sui#
```
Now you have the rights to reboot the virtual machine. Test it with the
following command:
```
    # reboot
```

P.S. When the script is executed the following message will be displayed in the
terminal:
```
    You have new mail in /var/mail/sui
```
You can check mail with the `mail` command:
```
    $ mail
```
Press Enter to load the last e-mail. The following lines assure you that you
have done everything right:
```
    Adding user `sui' to group `sudo' ...
    Adding user sui to group sudo
    Done.
```
If you've done something wrong an error message will be displayed:
```
    /tmp/smth: line 1: usermod: command not found
```
This will happen if you didn't specify the whole path to the `usermod` command.
